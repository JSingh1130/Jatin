Restaurant Reservation System
The Restaurant Reservation System is a full-stack web application designed to streamline and automate the process of reserving tables at a restaurant. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), this project provides users with a seamless experience to view available tables, select preferred reservation times, and book their tables online. On the back end, it efficiently manages customer data, reservation details, and table availability, ensuring a smooth and reliable booking process for both customers and restaurant staff. The project highlights the use of modern web technologies, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface, along with a scalable and maintainable backend architecture.
